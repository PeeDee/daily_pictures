So this is my first camping project and my fist git-controlled project...

The idea is that I've got a photo log of jpgs's, in the directory structure:

".../YYYY/prefixYYMMDD.gif"

and I want to server these up (for my iTouch actually) in a reasonable sequence.

I'm sick of keying in the url, so I thought a simple html page with a gif on it plus a link to the previous and next page's gif would be nice. It would be good if the url defaults to today's file.

That's all.
